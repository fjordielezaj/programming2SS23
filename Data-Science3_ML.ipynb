    "1) Accuracy: Accuracy measures the overall correctness of the model's predictions by calculating the ratio of correctly classified samples to the total number of samples. It provides a general measure of the model's performance but may not be suitable for imbalanced datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Precision: Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions (correctly predicted positive instances) out of all positive predictions made by the model. It focuses on the accuracy of positive predictions and is useful when the cost of false positives is high.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Recall (Sensitivity/True Positive Rate): Recall calculates the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances in the dataset. It is a measure of the model's ability to correctly identify positive instances and is useful when the cost of false negatives is high.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) F1-Score: The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It provides a balanced evaluation of the model's performance, taking into account both precision and recall. F1-score is a commonly used metric when the dataset is imbalanced or when you want to strike a balance between precision and recall."
