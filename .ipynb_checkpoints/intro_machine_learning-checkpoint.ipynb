Recently there's also been many talks about how machine learning algorithms are a black box, some rumors of machine learning models coming to life and becoming sentient, and jobs becoming obsolete because of tools such as ChatGPT, which is also built on an ML model. There's much to demistify here, so let's start from the very beginning."
